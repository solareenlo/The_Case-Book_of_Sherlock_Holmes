<p>It is a most singular thing that a problem which was certainly as
abstruse and unusual as any which I have faced in my long professional
career should have come to me after my retirement; and be brought, as
it were, to my very door.  It occurred after my withdrawal to my little
Sussex home, when I had given myself up entirely to that soothing life
of Nature for which I had so often yearned during the long years spent
amid the gloom of London.  At this period of my life the good Watson
had passed almost beyond my ken.  An occasional week-end visit was the
most that I ever saw of him.  Thus I must act as my own chronicler.
Ah! had he but been with me, how much he might have made of so
wonderful a happening and of my eventual triumph against every
difficulty!  As it is, however, I must needs tell my tale in my own
plain way, showing by my words each step upon the difficult road which
lay before me as I searched for the mystery of the Lion's Mane.</p>
<p>My villa is situated upon the southern slope of the Downs, commanding a
great view of the Channel.  At this point the coast-line is entirely of
chalk cliffs, which can only be descended by a single, long, tortuous
path, which is steep and slippery.  At the bottom of the path lie a
hundred yards of pebbles and shingle, even when the tide is at full.
Here and there, however, there are curves and hollows which make
splendid swimming-pools filled afresh with each flow.  This admirable
beach extends for some miles in each direction, save only at one point
where the little cove and village of Fulworth break the line.</p>
<p>My house is lonely.  I, my old housekeeper, and my bees have the estate
all to ourselves.  Half a mile off, however, is Harold Stackhurst's
well-known coaching establishment.  The Gables, quite a large place,
which contains some score of young fellows preparing for various
professions, with a staff of several masters.  Stackhurst himself was a
well-known rowing Blue in his day, and an excellent all-round scholar.
He and I were always friendly from the day I came to the coast, and he
was the one man who was on such terms with me that we could drop in on
each other in the evenings without an invitation.</p>
<p>Towards the end of July, 1907, there was a severe gale, the wind
blowing up-Channel, heaping the seas to the base of the cliffs, and
leaving a lagoon at the turn of the tide.  On the morning of which I
speak the wind had abated, and all Nature was newly washed and fresh.
It was impossible to work upon so delightful a day, and I strolled out
before breakfast to enjoy the exquisite air.  I walked along the cliff
path which led to the steep descent to the beach.  As I walked I heard
a shout behind me, and there was Harold Stackhurst waving his hand in
cheery greeting.</p>
<p>&quot;What a morning, Mr. Holmes!  I thought I should see you out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Going for a swim, I see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At your old tricks again,&quot; he laughed, patting his bulging pocket.
&quot;Yes.  McPherson started early, and I expect I may find him there.&quot;</p>
<p>Fitzroy McPherson was the science master, a fine upstanding young
fellow whose life had been crippled by heart trouble following
rheumatic fever.  He was a natural athlete, however, and excelled in
every game which did not throw too great a strain upon him.  Summer and
winter he went for his swim, and, as I am a swimmer myself, I have
often joined him.</p>
<p>At this moment we saw the man himself.  His head showed above the edge
of the cliff where the path ends.  Then his whole figure appeared at
the top, staggering like a drunken man.  The next instant he threw up
his hands, and, with a terrible cry, fell upon his face.  Stackhurst
and I rushed forward--it may have been fifty yards--and turned him on
his back.  He was obviously dying.  Those glazed sunken eyes and
dreadful livid cheeks could mean nothing else.  One glimmer of life
came into his face for an instant, and he uttered two or three words
with an eager air of warning.  They were slurred and indistinct, but to
my ear the last of them, which burst in a shriek from his lips, were
&quot;the lion's mane.&quot;  It was utterly irrelevant and unintelligible, and
yet I could twist the sound into no other sense.  Then he half raised
himself from the ground, threw his arms into the air and fell forward
on his side.  He was dead.</p>
<p>My companion was paralysed by the sudden horror of it, but I, as may
well be imagined, had every sense on the alert.  And I had need, for it
was speedily evident that we were in the presence of an extraordinary
case.  The man was dressed only in his Burberry overcoat, his trousers,
and an unlaced pair of canvas shoes.  As he fell over, his Burberry,
which had been simply thrown round his shoulders, slipped off, exposing
his trunk.  We stared at it in amazement.  His back was covered with
dark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged by a thin wire
scourge.  The instrument with which this punishment had been inflicted
was clearly flexible, for the long, angry weals curved round his
shoulders and ribs.  There was blood dripping down his chin, for he had
bitten through his lower lip in the paroxysm of his agony.  His drawn
and distorted face told how terrible that agony had been.</p>
<p>I was kneeling and Stackhurst standing by the body when a shadow fell
across us, and we found that Ian Murdoch was by our side.  Murdoch was
the mathematical coach at the establishment, a tall, dark, thin man, so
taciturn and aloof that none can be said to have been his friend.  He
seemed to live in some high, abstract region of surds and conic
sections with little to connect him with ordinary life.  He was looked
upon as an oddity by the students, and would have been their butt, but
there was some strange outlandish blood in the man, which showed itself
not only in his coal-black eyes and swarthy face, but also in
occasional outbreaks of temper, which could only be described as
ferocious.  On one occasion, being plagued by a little dog belonging to
McPherson, he had caught the creature up and hurled it through the
plate-glass window, an action for which Stackhurst would certainly have
given him his dismissal had he not been a very valuable teacher.  Such
was the strange, complex man who now appeared beside us.  He seemed to
be honestly shocked at the sight before him, though the incident of the
dog may show that there was no great sympathy between the dead man and
himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor fellow!  Poor fellow!  What can I do?  How can I help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were you with him?  Can you tell us what has happened?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, I was late this morning.  I was not on the beach at all.  I
have come straight from The Gables.  What can I do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can hurry to the police-station at Fulworth.  Report the matter at
once.&quot;</p>
<p>Without a word he made off at top speed, and I proceeded to take the
matter in hand, while Stackhurst, dazed at this tragedy, remained by
the body.  My first task naturally was to note who was on the beach.
From the top of the path I could see the whole sweep of it, and it was
absolutely deserted save that two or three dark figures could be seen
far away moving towards the village of Fulworth.  Having satisfied
myself upon this point, I walked slowly down the path.  There was clay
or soft marl mixed with the chalk, and every here and there I saw the
same footstep, both ascending and descending.  No one else had gone
down to the beach by this track that morning.  At one place I observed
the print of an open hand with the fingers towards the incline.  This
could only mean that poor McPherson had fallen as he ascended.  There
were rounded depressions, too, which suggested that he had come down
upon his knees more than once.  At the bottom of the path was the
considerable lagoon left by the retreating tide.  At the side of it
McPherson had undressed, for there lay his towel on a rock.  It was
folded and dry, so that it would seem that after all he had never
entered the water.  Once or twice as I hunted round amid the hard
shingle I came on little patches of sand where the print of his canvas
shoe, and also of his naked foot, could be seen.  The latter fact
proved that he had made all ready to bathe, though the towel indicated
that he had not actually done so.</p>
<p>And here was the problem clearly defined--as strange a one as had ever
confronted me.  The man had not been on the beach more than a quarter
of an hour at the most.  Stackhurst had followed him from The Gables,
so there could be no doubt about that.  He had gone to bathe and had
stripped, as the naked footsteps showed.  Then he had suddenly huddled
on his clothes again--they were all dishevelled and unfastened--and he
had returned without bathing, or at any rate without drying himself.
And the reason for his change of purpose had been that he had been
scourged in some savage, inhuman fashion, tortured until he bit his lip
through in his agony, and was left with only strength enough to crawl
away and to die.  Who had done this barbarous deed?  There were, it is
true, small grottos and caves in the base of the cliffs, but the low
sun shone directly into them, and there was no place for concealment.
Then, again, there were those distant figures on the beach.  They
seemed too far away to have been connected with the crime, and the
broad lagoon in which McPherson had intended to bathe lay between him
and them, lapping up to the rocks.  On the sea two or three
fishing-boats were at no great distance.  Their occupants might be
examined at our leisure.  There were several roads for inquiry, but
none which led to any very obvious goal.</p>
<p>When I at last returned to the body I found that a little group of
wandering folk had gathered round it.  Stackhurst was, of course, still
there, and Ian Murdoch had just arrived with Anderson, the village
constable, a big, ginger-moustached man of the slow, solid Sussex
breed--a breed which covers much good sense under a heavy, silent
exterior.  He listened to everything, took note of all we said, and
finally drew me aside.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd be glad of your advice, Mr. Holmes.  This is a big thing for me to
handle, and I'll hear of it from Lewes if I go wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>I advised him to send for his immediate superior, and for a doctor;
also to allow nothing to be moved, and as few fresh footmarks as
possible to be made, until they came.  In the meantime I searched the
dead man's pockets.  There were his handkerchief, a large knife, and a
small folding card-case.  From this projected a slip of paper, which I
unfolded and handed to the constable.  There was written on it in a
scrawling, feminine hand: &quot;I will be there, you may be sure.--Maudie.&quot;
It read like a love affair, an assignation, though when and where were
a blank.  The constable replaced it in the card-case and returned it
with the other things to the pockets of the Burberry.  Then, as nothing
more suggested itself, I walked back to my house for breakfast, having
first arranged that the base of the cliffs should be thoroughly
searched.</p>
<p>Stackhurst was round in an hour or two to tell me that the body had
been removed to The Gables, where the inquest would be held.  He
brought with him some serious and definite news.  As I expected,
nothing had been found in the small caves below the cliff, but he had
examined the papers in McPherson's desk, and there were several which
showed an intimate correspondence with a certain Miss Maud Bellamy, of
Fulworth.  We had then established the identity of the writer of the
note.</p>
<p>&quot;The police have the letters,&quot; he explained.  &quot;I could not bring them.
But there is no doubt that it was a serious love affair.  I see no
reason, however, to connect it with that horrible happening save,
indeed, that the lady had made an appointment with him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But hardly at a bathing-pool which all of you were in the habit of
using,&quot; I remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;It is mere chance,&quot; said he, &quot;that several of the students were not
with McPherson.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was it mere chance?&quot;</p>
<p>Stackhurst knit his brows in thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Ian Murdoch held them back,&quot; said he; &quot;he would insist upon some
algebraic demonstration before breakfast.  Poor chap, he is dreadfully
cut up about it all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet I gather that they were not friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At one time they were not.  But for a year or more Murdoch has been as
near to McPherson as he ever could be to anyone.  He is not of a very
sympathetic disposition by nature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I understand.  I seem to remember your telling me once about a
quarrel over the ill-usage of a dog.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That blew over all right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But left some vindictive feeling, perhaps.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; I am sure they were real friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, we must explore the matter of the girl.  Do you know her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone knows her.  She is the beauty of the neighbourhood--a real
beauty, Holmes, who would draw attention everywhere.  I knew that
McPherson was attracted by her, but I had no notion that it had gone so
far as these letters would seem to indicate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But who is she?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is the daughter of old Tom Bellamy, who owns all the boats and
bathing-cots at Fulworth.  He was a fisherman to start with, but is now
a man of some substance.  He and his son William run the business.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shall we walk into Fulworth and see them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On what pretext?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, we can easily find a pretext.  After all, this poor man did not
ill-use himself in this outrageous way.  Some human hand was on the
handle of that scourge, if indeed it was a scourge which inflicted the
injuries.  His circle of acquaintances in this lonely place was surely
limited.  Let us follow it up in every direction and we can hardly fail
to come upon the motive, which in turn should lead us to the criminal.&quot;</p>
<p>It would have been a pleasant walk across the thyme-scented Downs had
our minds not been poisoned by the tragedy we had witnessed.  The
village of Fulworth lies in a hollow curving in a semicircle round the
bay.  Behind the old-fashioned hamlet several modern houses have been
built upon the rising ground.  It was to one of these that Stackhurst
guided me.</p>
<p>&quot;That's The Haven, as Bellamy called it.  The one with the corner tower
and slate roof.  Not bad for a man who started with nothing but----  By
Jove, look at that!&quot;</p>
<p>The garden gate of The Haven had opened and a man had emerged.  There
was no mistaking that tall, angular, straggling figure.  It was Ian
Murdoch, the mathematician.  A moment later we confronted him upon the
road.</p>
<p>&quot;Hullo!&quot; said Stackhurst.  The man nodded, gave us a sideways glance
from his curious dark eyes, and would have passed us, but his principal
pulled him up.</p>
<p>&quot;What were you doing there?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>Murdoch's face flushed with anger.  &quot;I am your subordinate, sir, under
your roof.  I am not aware that I owe you any account of my private
actions.&quot;</p>
<p>Stackhurst's nerves were near the surface after all he had endured.
Otherwise, perhaps, he would have waited.  Now he lost his temper
completely.</p>
<p>&quot;In the circumstances your answer is pure impertinence, Mr. Murdoch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your own question might perhaps come under the same heading.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the first time that I have had to overlook your
insubordinate ways.  It will certainly be the last.  You will kindly
make fresh arrangements for your future as speedily as you can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had intended to do so.  I have lost to-day the only person who made
The Gables habitable.&quot;</p>
<p>He strode off upon his way, while Stackhurst, with angry eyes, stood
glaring after him.  &quot;Is he not an impossible, intolerable man?&quot; he
cried.</p>
<p>The one thing that impressed itself forcibly upon my mind was that Mr.
Ian Murdoch was taking the first chance to open a path of escape from
the scene of the crime.  Suspicion, vague and nebulous, was now
beginning to take outline in my mind.  Perhaps the visit to the
Bellamys might throw some further light upon the matter.  Stackhurst
pulled himself together and we went forward to the house.</p>
<p>Mr. Bellamy proved to be a middle-aged man with a flaming red beard.
He seemed to be in a very angry mood, and his face was soon as florid
as his hair.</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir, I do not desire any particulars.  My son here&quot;--indicating a
powerful young man, with a heavy, sullen face, in the corner of the
sitting-room--&quot;is of one mind with me that Mr. McPherson's attentions
to Maud were insulting.  Yes, sir, the word 'marriage' was never
mentioned, and yet there were letters and meetings, and a great deal
more of which neither of us could approve.  She has no mother, and we
are her only guardians.  We are determined----&quot;</p>
<p>But the words were taken from his mouth by the appearance of the lady
herself.  There was no gainsaying that she would have graced any
assembly in the world.  Who could have imagined that so rare a flower
would grow from such a root and in such an atmosphere?  Women have
seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always governed my
heart, but I could not look upon her perfect clear-cut face, with all
the soft freshness of the Downlands in her delicate colouring, without
realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed.  Such was
the girl who had pushed open the door and stood now, wide-eyed and
intense, in front of Harold Stackhurst.</p>
<p>&quot;I know already that Fitzroy is dead,&quot; she said.  &quot;Do not be afraid to
tell me the particulars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This other gentleman of yours let us know the news,&quot; explained the
father.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no reason why my sister should be brought into the matter,&quot;
growled the younger man.  The sister turned a sharp, fierce look upon
him.  &quot;This is my business, William.  Kindly leave me to manage it in
my own way.  By all accounts there has been a crime committed.  If I
can help to show who did it, it is the least I can do for him who is
gone.&quot;</p>
<p>She listened to a short account from my companion, with a composed
concentration which showed me that she possessed strong character as
well as great beauty.  Maud Bellamy will always remain in my memory as
a most complete and remarkable woman.  It seems that she already knew
me by sight, for she turned to me at the end.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring them to justice, Mr. Holmes.  You have my sympathy and my help,
whoever they may be.&quot;  It seemed to me that she glanced defiantly at
her father and brother as she spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said I.  &quot;I value a woman's instinct in such matters.  You
use the word 'they.'  You think that more than one was concerned?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I knew Mr. McPherson well enough to be aware that he was a brave and a
strong man.  No single person could ever have inflicted such an outrage
upon him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Might I have one word with you alone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you, Maud, not to mix yourself up in the matter,&quot; cried her
father angrily.</p>
<p>She looked at me helplessly.  &quot;What can I do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The whole world will know the facts presently, so there can be no harm
if I discuss them here,&quot; said I.  &quot;I should have preferred privacy, but
if your father will not allow it, he must share the deliberations.&quot;
Then I spoke of the note which had been found in the dead man's pocket.
&quot;It is sure to be produced at the inquest.  May I ask you to throw any
light upon it that you can?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see no reason for mystery,&quot; she answered.  &quot;We were engaged to be
married, and we only kept it secret because Fitzroy's uncle, who is
very old and said to be dying, might have disinherited him if he had
married against his wish.  There was no other reason.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could have told us,&quot; growled Mr. Bellamy.</p>
<p>&quot;So I would, father, if you had ever shown sympathy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I object to my girl picking up with men outside her own station.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was your prejudice against him which prevented us from telling you.
As to this appointment&quot;--she fumbled in her dress and produced a
crumpled note--&quot;it was in answer to this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;DEAREST,&quot; ran the message: &quot;The old place on the beach just after
sunset on Tuesday.  It is the only time I can get away.--F.M.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tuesday was to-day, and I had meant to meet him to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>I turned over the paper.  &quot;This never came by post.  How did you get
it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather not answer that question.  It has really nothing to do
with the matter which you are investigating.  But anything which bears
upon that I will most freely answer.&quot;</p>
<p>She was as good as her word, but there was nothing which was helpful in
our investigation.  She had no reason to think that her fiancé had any
hidden enemy, but she admitted that she had had several warm admirers.</p>
<p>&quot;May I ask if Mr. Ian Murdoch was one of them?&quot;</p>
<p>She blushed and seemed confused.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a time when I thought he was.  But that was all changed when
he understood the relations between Fitzroy and myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Again the shadow round this strange man seemed to me to be taking more
definite shape.  His record must be examined.  His rooms must be
privately searched.  Stackhurst was a willing collaborator, for in his
mind also suspicions were forming.  We returned from our visit to The
Haven with the hope that one free end of this tangled skein was already
in our hands.</p>
<p>A week passed.  The inquest had thrown no light upon the matter and had
been adjourned for further evidence.  Stackhurst had made discreet
inquiry about his subordinate, and there had been a superficial search
of his room, but without result.  Personally, I had gone over the whole
ground again, both physically and mentally, but with no new
conclusions.  In all my chronicles the reader will find no case which
brought me so completely to the limit of my powers.  Even my
imagination could conceive no solution to the mystery.  And then there
came the incident of the dog.</p>
<p>It was my old housekeeper who heard of it first by that strange
wireless by which such people collect the news of the country-side.</p>
<p>&quot;Sad story this, sir, about Mr. McPherson's dog,&quot; said she one evening.</p>
<p>I do not encourage such conversations, but the words arrested my
attention.</p>
<p>&quot;What of Mr. McPherson's dog?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead, sir.  Died of grief for its master.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who told you this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, sir, everyone is talking of it.  It took on terrible, and has
eaten nothing for a week.  Then to-day two of the young gentlemen from
The Gables found it dead--down on the beach, sir, at the very place
where its master met his end.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the very place.&quot;  The words stood out clear in my memory.  Some dim
perception that the matter was vital rose in my mind.  That the dog
should die was after the beautiful, faithful nature of dogs.  But 'in
the very place'!  Why should this lonely beach be fatal to it?  Was it
possible that it also, had been sacrificed to some revengeful feud?
Was it possible----?  Yes, the perception was dim, but already
something was building up in my mind.  In a few minutes I was on my way
to The Gables, where I found Stackhurst in his study.  At my request he
sent for Sudbury and Blount, the two students who had found the dog.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it lay on the very edge of the pool,&quot; said one of them.  &quot;It must
have followed the trail of its dead master.&quot;</p>
<p>I saw the faithful little creature, an Airedale terrier, laid out upon
the mat in the hall.  The body was stiff and rigid, the eyes
projecting, and the limbs contorted.  There was agony in every line of
it.</p>
<p>From The Gables I walked down to the bathing-pool.  The sun had sunk
and the shadow of the great cliff lay black across the water, which
glimmered dully like a sheet of lead, The place was deserted and there
was no sign of life save for two sea-birds circling and screaming
overhead.  In the fading light I could dimly make out the little dog's
spoor upon the sand round the very rock on which his master's towel had
been laid.  For a long time I stood in deep meditation while the
shadows grew darker around me.  My mind was filled with racing
thoughts.  You have known what it was to be in a nightmare in which you
feel that there is some all-important thing for which you search and
which you know is there, though it remains for ever just beyond your
reach.  That was how I felt that evening as I stood alone by that place
of death.  Then at last I turned and walked slowly homewards.  I had
just reached the top of the path when it came to me.  Like a flash, I
remembered the thing for which I had so eagerly and vainly grasped.
You will know, or Watson has written in vain, that I hold a vast store
of out-of-the-way knowledge, without scientific system, but very
available for the needs of my work.  My mind is like a crowded box-room
with packets of all sorts stowed away therein--so many that I may well
have but a vague perception of what was there.  I had known that there
was something which might bear upon this matter.  It was still vague,
but at least I knew how I could make it clear.  It was monstrous,
incredible, and yet it was always a possibility.  I would test it to
the full.  There is a great garret in my little house which is stuffed
with books.  It was into this that I plunged and rummaged for an hour.
At the end of that time I emerged with a little chocolate and silver
volume.  Eagerly I turned up the chapter of which I had a dim
remembrance.  Yes, it was indeed a far-fetched and unlikely
proposition, and yet I could not be at rest until I had made sure if it
might, indeed, be so.  It was late when I retired, with my mind eagerly
awaiting the work of the morrow.</p>
<p>But that work met with an annoying interruption.  I had hardly
swallowed my early cup of tea and was starting for the beach when I had
a call from Inspector Bardie of the Sussex Constabulary--a steady,
solid, bovine man with thoughtful eyes, which looked at me now with a
very troubled expression.</p>
<p>&quot;I know your immense experience, sir,&quot; said he.  &quot;This is quite
unofficial, of course, and need go no farther.  But I am fairly up
against it in this McPherson case.  The question is, shall I make an
arrest, or shall I not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Meaning Mr. Ian Murdoch?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir.  There is really no one else when you come to think of it.
That's the advantage of this solitude.  We narrow it down to a very
small compass.  If he did not do it, then who did?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What have you against him?&quot;</p>
<p>He had gleaned along the same furrows as I had.  There was Murdoch's
character and the mystery which seemed to hang round the man.  His
furious bursts of temper, as shown in the incident of the dog.  The
fact that he had quarrelled with McPherson in the past, and that there
was some reason to think that he might have resented his attentions to
Miss Bellamy.  He had all my points, but no fresh ones, save that
Murdoch seemed to be making every preparation for departure.</p>
<p>&quot;What would my position be if I let him slip away with all this
evidence against him?&quot;  The burly, phlegmatic man was sorely troubled
in his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Consider,&quot; I said, &quot;all the essential gaps in your case.  On the
morning of the crime he can surely prove an alibi.  He had been with
his scholars till the last moment, and within a few minutes of
McPherson's appearance he came upon us from behind.  Then bear in mind
the absolute impossibility that he could single-handed have inflicted
this outrage upon a man quite as strong as himself.  Finally, there is
this question of the instrument with which these injuries were
inflicted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What could it be but a scourge or flexible whip of some sort?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you examined the marks?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen them.  So has the doctor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I have examined them very carefully with a lens.  They have
peculiarities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are they, Mr. Holmes?&quot;</p>
<p>I stepped to my bureau and brought out an enlarged photograph.  &quot;This
is my method in such cases,&quot; I explained.</p>
<p>&quot;You certainly do things thoroughly, Mr. Holmes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should hardly be what I am if I did not.  Now let us consider this
weal which extends round the right shoulder.  Do you observe nothing
remarkable?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't say I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Surely it is evident that it is unequal in its intensity.  There is a
dot of extravasated blood, here, and another there.  There are similar
indications in this other weal down here.  What can that mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no idea.  Have you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps I have.  Perhaps I haven't.  I may be able to say more soon.
Anything which will define what made that mark will bring us a long way
towards the criminal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is, of course, an absurd idea,&quot; said the policeman, &quot;but if a
red-hot net of wire had been laid across the back, then these
better-marked points would represent where the meshes crossed each
other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A most ingenious comparison.  Or shall we say a very stiff
cat-o'-nine-tails with small hard knots upon it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By Jove, Mr. Holmes, I think you have hit it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or there may be some very different cause, Mr. Bardie.  But your case
is far too weak for an arrest.  Besides, we have those last
words--'Lion's Mane.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have wondered whether Ian----&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I have considered that.  If the second word had borne any
resemblance to Murdoch--but it did not.  He gave it almost in a shriek.
I am sure that it was 'Mane.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you no alternative, Mr. Holmes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps I have.  But I do not care to discuss it until there is
something more solid to discuss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And when will that be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In an hour--possibly less.&quot;</p>
<p>The Inspector rubbed his chin and looked at me with dubious eyes..</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could see what was in your mind, Mr. Holmes.  Perhaps it's
those fishing-boats.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; they were too far out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, is it Bellamy and that big son of his?  They were not too
sweet upon Mr. McPherson.  Could they have done him a mischief?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; you won't draw me until I am ready,&quot; said I with a smile.
&quot;Now, Inspector, we each have our own work to do.  Perhaps if you were
to meet me here at midday----?&quot;</p>
<p>So far we had got when there came the tremendous interruption which was
the beginning of the end.  My outer door was flung open, there were
blundering footsteps in the passage, and Ian Murdoch staggered into the
room, pallid, dishevelled, his clothes in wild disorder, clawing with
his bony hands at the furniture to hold himself erect.  &quot;Brandy!
Brandy!&quot; he gasped, and fell groaning upon the sofa.</p>
<p>He was not alone.  Behind him came Stackhurst, hatless and panting,
almost as distrait as his companion.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, brandy!&quot; he cried.  &quot;The man is at his last gasp.  It was
all I could do to bring him here.  He fainted twice upon the way.&quot;</p>
<p>Half a tumbler of the raw spirit brought about a wondrous change.  He
pushed himself up on one arm and swung his coat from off his shoulders.
&quot;For God's sake! oil, opium, morphia!&quot; he cried.  &quot;Anything to ease
this infernal agony!&quot;</p>
<p>The Inspector and I cried out at the sight.  There, criss-crossed upon
the man's naked shoulder, was the same strange reticulated pattern of
red, inflamed lines which had been the death-mark of Fitzroy McPherson.</p>
<p>The pain was evidently terrible and was more than local, for the
sufferer's breathing would stop for a time, his face would turn black,
and then with loud gasps he would clap his hand to his heart, while his
brow dropped beads of sweat.  At any moment he might die.  More and
more brandy was poured down his throat, each fresh dose bringing him
back to life.  Pads of cotton-wool soaked in salad-oil seemed to take
the agony from the strange wounds.  At last his head fell heavily upon
the cushion.  Exhausted Nature had taken refuge in its last storehouse
of vitality.  It was half a sleep and half a faint, but at least it was
ease from pain.</p>
<p>To question him had been impossible, but the moment we were assured of
his condition Stackhurst turned upon me.</p>
<p>&quot;My God!&quot; he cried, &quot;what is it, Holmes?  What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you find him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Down on the beach.  Exactly where poor McPherson met his end.  If this
man's heart had been weak as McPherson's was, he would not be here now.
More than once I thought he was gone as I brought him up.  It was too
far to The Gables, so I made for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you see him on the beach?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was walking on the cliff when I heard his cry.  He was at the edge
of the water, reeling about like a drunken man.  I ran down, threw some
clothes about him, and brought him up.  For Heaven's sake, Holmes, use
all the powers you have and spare no pains to lift the curse from this
place, for life is becoming unendurable.  Can you, with all your
world-wide reputation, do nothing for us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I can, Stackhurst.  Come with me now!  And you, Inspector,
come along!  We will see if we cannot deliver this murderer into your
hands.&quot;</p>
<p>Leaving the unconscious man in the charge of my housekeeper, we all
three went down to the deadly lagoon.  On the shingle there was piled a
little heap of towels and clothes, left by the stricken man.  Slowly I
walked round the edge of the water, my comrades in Indian file behind
me.  Most of the pool was quite shallow, but under the cliff where the
beach was hollowed out it was four or five feet deep.  It was to this
part that a swimmer would naturally go, for it formed a beautiful
pellucid green pool as clear as crystal.  A line of rocks lay above it
at the base of the cliff, and along this I led the way, peering eagerly
into the depths beneath me.  I had reached the deepest and stillest
pool when my eyes caught that for which they were searching, and I
burst into a shout of triumph.</p>
<p>&quot;Cyanea!&quot; I cried.  &quot;Cyanea!  Behold the Lion's Mane!&quot;</p>
<p>The strange object at which I pointed did indeed look like a tangled
mass torn from the mane of a lion.  It lay upon a rocky shelf some
three feet under the water, a curious waving, vibrating, hairy creature
with streaks of silver among its yellow tresses.  It pulsated with a
slow, heavy dilation and contraction.</p>
<p>&quot;It has done mischief enough.  Its day is over!&quot; I cried.  &quot;Help me,
Stackhurst!  Let us end the murderer for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a big boulder just above the ledge, and we pushed it until it
fell with a tremendous splash into the water.  When the ripples had
cleared we saw that it had settled upon the ledge below.  One flapping
edge of yellow membrane showed that our victim was beneath it.  A thick
oily scum oozed out from below the stone and stained the water round,
rising slowly to the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this gets me!&quot; cried the Inspector.  &quot;What was it, Mr. Holmes?
I'm born and bred in these parts, but I never saw such a thing.  It
don't belong to Sussex.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just as well for Sussex,&quot; I remarked.  &quot;It may have been the
south-west gale that brought it up.  Come back to my house, both of
you, and I will give you the terrible experience of one who has good
reason to remember his own meeting with the same peril of the seas.&quot;</p>
<p>When we reached my study, we found that Murdoch was so far recovered
that he could sit up.  He was dazed in mind, and every now and then was
shaken by a paroxysm of pain.  In broken words he explained that he had
no notion what had occurred to him, save that terrific pangs had
suddenly shot through him, and that it had taken all his fortitude to
reach the bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Here is a book,&quot; I said, taking up the little volume, &quot;which first
brought light into what might have been for ever dark.  It is <em>Out of
Doors</em>, by the famous observer J. G. Wood.  Wood himself very nearly
perished from contact with this vile creature, so he wrote with a very
full knowledge.  <em>Cyanea Capillata</em> is the miscreant's full name, and
he can be as dangerous to life as, and far more painful than, the bite
of the cobra.  Let me briefly give this extract.</p>
<p>&quot;'If the bather should see a loose roundish mass of tawny membranes and
fibres, something like very large handfuls of lion's mane and silver
paper, let him beware, for this is the fearful stinger, <em>Cyanea
Capillata</em>.' Could our sinister acquaintance be more clearly described?</p>
<p>&quot;He goes on to tell his own encounter with one when swimming off the
coast of Kent.  He found that the creature radiated almost invisible
filaments to the distance of fifty feet, and that anyone within that
circumference from the deadly centre was in danger of death.  Even at a
distance the effect upon Wood was almost fatal.  'The multitudinous
threads caused light scarlet lines upon the skin which on closer
examination resolved into minute dots or pustules, each dot charged as
it were with a red-hot needle making its way through the nerves.'</p>
<p>&quot;The local pain was, as he explains, the least part of the exquisite
torment.  'Pangs shot through the chest, causing me to fall as if
struck by a bullet.  The pulsation would cease, and then the heart
would give six or seven leaps as if it would force its way through the
chest.'</p>
<p>&quot;It nearly killed him, although he had only been exposed to it in the
disturbed ocean and not in the narrow calm waters of a bathing-pool.
He says that he could hardly recognize himself afterwards, so white,
wrinkled and shrivelled was his face.  He gulped down brandy, a whole
bottleful, and it seems to have saved his life.  There is the book,
Inspector.  I leave it with you, and you cannot doubt that it contains
a full explanation of the tragedy of poor McPherson.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And incidentally exonerates me,&quot; remarked Ian Murdoch with a wry
smile.  &quot;I do not blame you, Inspector, nor you, Mr. Holmes, for your
suspicions were natural.  I feel that on the very eve of my arrest I
have only cleared myself by sharing the fate of my poor friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Mr. Murdoch.  I was already upon the track, and had I been out as
early as I intended I might well have saved you from this terrific
experience.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how did you know, Mr. Holmes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am an omnivorous reader with a strangely retentive memory for
trifles.  That phrase 'Lion's Mane' haunted my mind.  I knew that I had
seen it somewhere in an unexpected context.  You have seen that it does
describe the creature.  I have no doubt that it was floating on the
water when McPherson saw it, and that this phrase was the only one by
which he could convey to us a warning as to the creature which had been
his death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I, at least, am cleared,&quot; said Murdoch, rising slowly to his
feet.  &quot;There are one or two words of explanation which I should give,
for I know the direction in which your inquiries have run.  It is true
that I loved this lady, but from the day when she chose my friend
McPherson my one desire was to help her to happiness.  I was well
content to stand aside and act as their go-between.  Often I carried
their messages, and it was because I was in their confidence and
because she was so dear to me that I hastened to tell her of my
friend's death, lest someone should forestall me in a more sudden and
heartless manner.  She would not tell you, sir, of our relations lest
you should disapprove and I might suffer.  But with your leave I must
try to get back to The Gables, for my bed will be very welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>Stackhurst held out his hand.  &quot;Our nerves have all been at
concert-pitch,&quot; said he.  &quot;Forgive what is past, Murdoch.  We shall
understand each other better in the future.&quot;  They passed out together
with their arms linked in friendly fashion.  The Inspector remained,
staring at me in silence with his ox-like eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you've done it!&quot; he cried at last.  &quot;I had read of you, but I
never believed it.  It's wonderful!&quot;</p>
<p>I was forced to shake my head.  To accept such praise was to lower
one's own standards.</p>
<p>&quot;I was slow at the outset--culpably slow.  Had the body been found in
the water I could hardly have missed it.  It was the towel which misled
me.  The poor fellow had never thought to dry himself, and so I in turn
was led to believe that he had never been in the water.  Why, then,
should the attack of any water creature suggest itself to me?  That was
where I went astray.  Well, well, Inspector, I often ventured to chaff
you gentlemen of the police force, but <em>Cyanea Capillata</em> very nearly
avenged Scotland Yard.&quot;</p>
